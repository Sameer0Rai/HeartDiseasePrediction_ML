# Heart Disease Prediction Model

## Overview

This project implements a heart disease prediction model using Logistic Regression and Scikit-learn. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various health parameters, and it predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients. The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy scores.

## Features

- **Logistic Regression Model:** Utilizes logistic regression for binary classification of heart disease.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data cleaning and preparation steps.
- **Train-Test Split:** The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses accuracy score as the primary metric to assess the model's performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
